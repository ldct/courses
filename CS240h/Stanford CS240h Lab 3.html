<h1 class="title">Stanford CS240h Lab 3</h1>
</header>
<p>In this lab, you will build a multi-way file synchronizer called <code>trahs</code>. This is will be a simplified version of the <a href="http://swtch.com/tra/">tra</a> file synchronizer described in <a href="http://publications.csail.mit.edu/tmp/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2005-014.pdf">File Synchronization with Vector Time Pairs</a> by Rus Cox and William Josephson.</p>
<p>We are providing a skeleton Cabal project to help get started, download it from <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/14sp-cs240h/labs/lab3.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="no-lost-updates">No Lost Updates</h2>
<p>Your task will be to synchronize all the files in a single directory across multiple machines respecting the <em>no lost updates</em> rule. At a high level, the no lost updates rule considers the update history of a file. It says that when synchronizing two versions of a file, <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>2</sub></span>, it is okay to discard version <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> and replace it with version <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>2</sub></span> only if <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>2</sub></span>'s history is a superset of <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span>'s. In other words, none of the updates made to <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> are being discarded. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a file has changed on only one machine since the last synchronization, then the change should be propagated to the other machine.</li>
<li>If a file has been deleted on only one machine (and remains unchanged on the other), then the deletion should be propagated to the other machine.</li>
<li>If a file has changed on both machines, then you must detect this and report a conflict, as neither version can replace the other.</li>
<li>If a file has changed on one machine (<code>A</code>) and been deleted on the other (<code>B</code>), this is also a kind of conflict. For this lab, you will automatically resolve such conflicts by propagating the changed file from machine <code>A</code> to machine <code>B</code>. (Put another way, the only "updates" it is permissible to lose are file deletions when there is a conflicting update.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-session">Example Session</h2>
<p>For example, here is how your program might behave when synchronizing between two machines, garage (directory <code>market-test</code>) and market (directory <code>cs240h/test</code>).</p>
<p>Initially, garage is empty while market has two files, <code>fileA</code> and <code>fileB</code>:</p>
<pre><code>market 1$ cd cs240h/test
market 2$ ls
fileA fileB
market 3$ cat fileA
content a
market 4$ cat fileB
content b</code></pre>
<p>We run a first session, bringing garage and market into sync:</p>
<pre><code>garage 753$ trahs market:cs240h/test market-test
fetching "fileA"
fetching "fileB"
=== switching from client to server ===</code></pre>
<p>The output above the <code>=== switching from ...</code> line is for the commands required to update garage (the client), while output below is for the commands required to update market. This denotes the fact that after pulling all changes from market, the trahs process on garage has switched roles to allow market to pull any changes. (In this case there are no changes to send to market.)</p>
<p>Now that they are in sync, we make some updates:</p>
<pre><code>garage 754$ echo contents of file c &gt; market-test/fileC
garage 755$ echo more contents for file b &gt;&gt; market-test/fileB </code></pre>
<p>We run <code>trahs</code> again to sync the changes from garage to market:</p>
<pre><code>garage 756$ trahs market:cs240h/test market-test
=== switching from client to server ===
fetching "fileB"
fetching "fileC"</code></pre>
<p>Note that now the changes are being reported by market, which has fetched <code>fileB</code> and <code>fileC</code> from garage. Now, we create a conflict and delete some files:</p>
<pre><code>garage 757$ echo create conflict &gt; market-test/fileA 
garage 758$ rm market-test/fileB market-test/fileC 
garage 759$ ssh market
Last login: Fri Apr 25 12:28:06 2014 from ...
market 1$ echo more content &gt;&gt; cs240h/test/fileA
market 2$ echo more content &gt;&gt; cs240h/test/fileB
market 3$ logout</code></pre>
<p>After command 3 on market in the above transcript, <code>fileA</code> has been modified on both machines, <code>fileB</code> has been modified on market and deleted on garage, and <code>fileC</code> has been deleted on garage.</p>
<p>Next, we re-run <code>trahs</code> to bring garage and market back into sync:</p>
<pre><code>garage 760$ trahs market:cs240h/test market-test
conflicting "fileA"
fetching "fileB"
=== switching from client to server ===
deleting "fileA"
fetching "fileA#3702144909419514571.5"
fetching "fileA#9192274446083366835.5"
deleting "fileC"</code></pre>
<p>This should leave us with a directory as so:</p>
<pre><code>garage 761$ ls -al market-test/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  2 dm   dm    120 Apr 25 12:29 .
drwxrwxrwt 54 root root 1680 Apr 25 12:30 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 dm   dm    721 Apr 25 12:29 .trahs.db
-rw-r--r--  1 dm   dm     16 Apr 25 12:29 fileA#3702144909419514571.5
-rw-r--r--  1 dm   dm     23 Apr 25 12:29 fileA#9192274446083366835.5
-rw-r--r--  1 dm   dm     48 Apr 25 12:29 fileB
garage 762$ cat market-test/fileB
content b
more contents for file b
more content
garage 763$ </code></pre>
<p>After synchronization, the following is the state of the file system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are now two versions of <code>fileA</code>. Hence, <code>fileA</code> itself is gone, and the two conflicting versions are called <code>fileA#3702144909419514571.5</code> and <code>fileA#9192274446083366835.5</code>. Those two number signify that one version was found on replica <code>3702144909419514571</code> when that replica was at version 5, and the other was found on replica <code>9192274446083366835</code> when that replica was at version 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Though <code>fileB</code> was deleted on garage, it was also modified on market. Though this is a conflict, we simply resolve the conflict by overruling the deletion, and now market's version of <code>fileB</code> exists on garage.</p></li>
<li><p><code>fileC</code> was deleted on garage. Moreover, the particular version deleted on garage contained all the changes known by market. Hence the deletion is propagated to market, and the file no longer exists.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though this example shows only two hosts, your synchronizer should work with an arbitrary number of hosts. Moreover, pairwise synchronizations should be possible between all pairs of replicas in any order. For instance, if A synchronizes with B and then B synchronizes with C, the results should be the same as if A synchronized with C directly (after A learns all changes on B, of course).</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The main challenge in file synchronization is deciding, when the state of two files differs, whether there is an update conflict, or whether one version of the file is based on the other and hence supersedes it. In the latter case, of course you also need to figure out which version is newer. To keep track of this information, you will need to store some extra synchronization state in either a file or directory with the special reserved name <code>.trahs.db</code>.</p>
<p>As described in this section, synchronization happens in one direction from a server to a client. To achieve bidirectional synchronization, your program should end by flipping the protocol around and performing the same actions in the other direction.</p>
<h3 id="overall-architecture">Overall architecture</h3>
<p>The <code>trahs</code> command should take exactly two command-line arguments:</p>
<pre><code>trahs SERVER:SERVER-DIR CLIENT-DIR</code></pre>
<p>Once it finishes running, <code>CLIENT-DIR</code> on the client and <code>SERVER-DIR</code> on machine <code>SERVER</code> should have the same contents.</p>
<p>You should write <code>trahs</code> with the expectation that an identical copy of <code>trahs</code> will be available on the server. <code>trahs</code> should use <code>ssh</code> to run the copy of itself on the server. To make finding <code>trahs</code> easier, we recommend putting a link to your build directory into your home directory, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>$ ln -s ~/cs240h/trahs/dist/build/trahs/trahs ~/trahs</code></pre>
<p>On the server, you will likely want <code>trahs</code> to run in a special server mode, which you might indicate with a special command-line option, <code>--server</code>, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>./trahs --server SERVER-DIR</code></pre>
<h3 id="synchronization-state">Synchronization state</h3>
<p>Synchronization data needed on each server should be stored in the directory that is being synchronized as either a file or subdirectory using the special reserved name <code>.trahs.db</code>.</p>
<p>Each replica will need to store the following information for a synchronized directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A unique <em>replica ID</em>. The first time <code>trahs</code> is run on a particular directory, it should randomly generate a replica ID for itself. The replica ID should then never change.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>local version number</em> that starts at 1 and increments every time <code>trahs</code> is run.</p></li>
<li><p>For each file, a <em>write stamp</em> consisting of replica ID and version number of the file's last update. The replica ID corresponds to the replica that created this version of the file; the version number is that replica's local version number at the time <code>trahs</code> saw that version of the file.</p></li>
<li><p>For each file, a way to determine if the file has been locally modified since the last time <code>trahs</code> was run. One way to do this is to store a collision-resistant (SHA-256) hash of the file's contents. Another way is to store both the size and modification time of the file. Yet another approach is to combine the previous two: Track file contents by SHA-256 hash, but also store size and mtime and only bother re-hashing a file if one of the other two values has changed.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>version vector</em> reflecting how up to date the local replica is with respect to other replicas. More specifically, a version vector is a map from replica ID to version number. A replica's own replica ID always maps to its latest local version number. (Hence, you do not actually need to store the local version number separately.) Conceptually, any replica IDs not in the version vector are mapped to version number 0. After synchronizing from a remote replica, the local replica should set its version vector to the element-wise maximum of old local version vector and the remote version vector.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="synchronization-algorithm">Synchronization algorithm</h3>
<p>One-way synchronization from a server to a client proceeds in four phases. First, both sides bump their local version numbers and scan their local directories to discover any files that have changed. Second, the server sends its current state to the client. Third, the client merges the server's state into its local directory, downloading any missing files from the server. Fourth, the client updates its version vector.</p>
<p>The first phase consists of finding modified files in the local directory. <code>trahs</code> must read the directory and compare each file to the hash and/or size+mtime information last recorded. If the file has changed, <code>trahs</code> sets the file's write stamp to the local replica ID and version number (as the changes are not reflected on any other replica).</p>
<p>In the second phase, the server simply sends the client its version vector and a list of (file name, writestamp) pairs describing the contents of the directory. (Besides a writestamp, the per-file information can be augmented with other information such as SHA-256 hashes. You may find it simplest just to dump the server's entire database to the client.)</p>
<p>In the third phase, the client merges the remote server state into its own local state. This is the heart of the algorithm, and it makes use of four pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The local (client's) version vector. Let's call it <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em></span>. We'll use the notation <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em></span> to refer to the version number of replica <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> in <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em></span>. If <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> does not appear in <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em></span>, then <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em> = 0</span>.</li>
<li>The remote (server's) version vector. Let's call it <span class="math"><em>R</em><em>V</em><em>V</em></span>. We define <span class="math"><em>R</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em></span> analogously to <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em></span>.</li>
<li>For each file that exists locally, the local writestamp. Let's call it <em>LWS</em>. If the file does not exist locally, there will be no LWS. we write <span class="math"><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span> for the two components of the writestamp.</li>
<li>For each file that exists remotely, the remote writestamp. Let's call it <span class="math"><em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em></span>, and similarly access the two fields as <span class="math"><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span> and <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for each file we proceed by cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the file exists on both the client and server and <span class="math"><em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em> = <em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em></span>, there is nothing to do.</p></li>
<li><p>If the files differ, but <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>) ≤ <em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span>, then the client already learned about the server's version in some previous synchronization and subsequently overwrote it. Hence, the client ignores the server's version and keeps its own with no change.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, if <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>) ≤ <em>R</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span>, then the server knew about and overwrote the client's version. Hence the client downloads the new version from the server, replaces the local file with the contents of the remote one, and also replaces the local writestamp with the remote one in the synchronization state (<span class="math"><em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em> ← <em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em></span>).</p></li>
<li><p>If the file exists on both replicas and none of the above cases holds, flag a conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>If the file exists on neither the client nor server (deleted or never created on both), there is obviously nothing to do.</p></li>
<li><p>If the file exists only on the server, then download it only if the client has not previously downloaded that version or a version that supersedes it (i.e., download only if <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>) &gt; <em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>R</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span>). Otherwise, ignore the file as it was previously downloaded and deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>If the file exists only on the client, then delete it only if the server previously had the client's version of the file or a version derived from it. In other words, delete only if <span class="math"><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>) ≤ <em>R</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>r</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em>(<em>L</em><em>W</em><em>S</em>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the fourth phase, the client sets its version vector to contain the replica-wise maximum of its previous contents and the values in the remote server's version vector. This ensures that <span class="math">∀<em>R</em>.<em>L</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em> ≥ <em>R</em><em>V</em><em>V</em>!<em>R</em></span>, reflecting the fact that the client now knows everything the server knows.</p>
<h3 id="comparison-to-tra">Comparison to <code>tra</code></h3>
<p>This assignment has several simplifications compared to the work described in the <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/14sp-cs240h/labs/traTR">tra paper</a>. You only need to synchronize a single directory and can ignore anything (including symbolic links) that is not a regular file.</p>
<p>Another simplification is that <code>tra</code> keeps a second writestamp corresponding to file creation. This allows one to differentiate between a deletion that conflicts with an update and one that doesn't. But since we always resolve deletion conflicts by superseding the deletion event, the extra information is unnecessary for <code>trahs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="hints-and-suggestions">Hints and suggestions</h2>
<p>The instructor was able to complete the assignment in approximately 250 lines of Haskell (not counting comments), without using any language extensions. Based on that implementation, here are some suggestions that may help you out. These are not requirements.</p>
<h3 id="libraries-and-idioms">Libraries and idioms</h3>
<p>In addition to base, you may find the following packages useful: bytestring, containers, directory, filepath, process, random, SHA2, unix-compat.</p>
<p>Module <code>System.PosixCompat</code> in the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat">unix-compat</a> package has useful functions for file attributes, and has the advantage of working on both Unix/Linux and other operating systems. (It just reexports the unix package on Unix-like systems.)</p>
<p>You will also likely find the use of <code>Data.Map</code> or <code>Data.Map.Strict</code> in the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/contns">containers library</a> quite handy, both to represent version vectors and to store per-file information.</p>
<p>You will likely want to call</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">  hSetBuffering h <span class="dt">LineBuffering</span></code></pre>
<p>on file handles <code>h</code> used for communication between the client and server (including <code>stdout</code> on the server). Otherwise, data you write to the peer <code>trahs</code> process may get buffered, and your process may get stuck.</p>
<p>Using lazy IO to operate on whole files will make certain operations very concise. For example, the following function computes the SHA-256 hash of a file, but by virtue of lazy IO does not actually need to store the whole file in memory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Codec.Digest.SHA</span>
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Control.Applicative</span>
<span class="kw">import qualified</span> <span class="dt">Data.ByteString.Lazy</span> <span class="kw">as</span> <span class="dt">L</span>

<span class="ot">hashFile ::</span> <span class="dt">FilePath</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dt">String</span>
hashFile path <span class="fu">=</span> showBSasHex <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> (hash <span class="dt">SHA256</span> <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> L.readFile path)</code></pre>
<p>Similar tricks are useful when copying an entire file to or from a handle connected to a peer <code>trahs</code>.</p>
<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p>A simple text-based protocol is easiest to debug. For instance, you might have a command to retrieve the server's state, and another command to fetch a file.</p>
<p>Each command can end with a newline so you can read commands with <code>hGetLine</code>. To avoid duplicating code on the client and server, you can have a special command <code>TURN</code> that causes the server to become the client. (But obviously be careful not to execute such a command more than once, or you will go into an infinite loop and never finish synchronizing.)</p>
<p>Make sure you send all your diagnostics to stderr (with <code>hPutStrLn stderr ...</code>). Otherwise, diagnostic output on the server may get interleaved with your protocol and confuse <code>trahs</code> or corrupt files.</p>
<h3 id="simplifying-assumptions">Simplifying assumptions</h3>
<p>In order to simplify the problem, feel free to make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can safely reserve some file (or directory) name to store synchronization information. For example, you might store all your synchronization information in the same directory in a file called <code>.trahs.db</code>. And when updating the file (for crash recoverability), you might write new versions of the state to a file called <code>.trahs.db~</code> and then <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.4.1.1/docs/System-PosixCompat-Files.html#v:rename">rename</a> <code>.trahs.db~</code> to <code>trahs.db</code>. (Obviously your program then needs to skip these files when synchronizing.)</p></li>
<li><p>You only need to synchronize the regular files in a single directory, as determined by <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.4.1.1/docs/System-PosixCompat-Files.html#v:isRegularFile"><code>isRegularFile</code></a>. You can ignore subdirectories, devices, pipes, sockets, and even symbolic links. Make sure you call <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.4.1.1/docs/System-PosixCompat-Files.html#v:getSymbolicLinkStatus"><code>getSymbolicLinkStatus</code></a> and not <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.4.1.1/docs/System-PosixCompat-Files.html#v:getFileStatus"><code>getFileStatus</code></a> to detect symbolic links.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't need to worry about funny file names (e.g., containing space characters).</p></li>
<li><p>You can assume the <code>trahs</code> executable (or a symbolic link to it) is in your home directory on all machines. Thus, executing <code>ssh -CTaxq   HOST ./trahs --server ARGS...</code> is sufficient to connect you to a <code>trahs</code> server process on <code>HOST</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can assume filename lengths are nowhere near the limit, so it is okay to append version numbers and such to file names when reporting conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to worry about modifications being made to the directory at either end while your program is running.</p></li>
<li><p>If a file's size and time returned by <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.4.1.1/docs/System-PosixCompat-Files.html#v:modificationTime"><code>modificationTime</code></a> have not changed between two invocations of <code>trahs</code>, you can assume the content of the file has not changed either.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume there are few enough replicas that if you generate a random ~63-bit integer to identify each replica, the probability of two replicas ending up with the same ID is negligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you need shell access to run <code>trahs</code> anyway, you do not need to worry about either end of a connection being malicious. You can furthermore avoid any protocol version negotiation and just assume both ends are running the exact same version of the <code>trahs</code> program.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume directories are small enough that it is fine to store all synchronization state in memory, to read and write it to disk all at once, and to exchange a complete list of all files on every synchronization event</p></li>
<li><p>It is fine to use <code>show</code> and <code>read</code> to serialize and unserialize synchronization state for both the database and the network protocol. Though <code>show</code> output is not very compact, it has the big advantage of being human readable, which will help you debug.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you are ignoring directories, you don't need to worry about conflicts between files and directories (i.e., a file name that is a file on one replica and a directory on another).</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to worry about synchronizing file permissions, such as the execute bit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-two-trahs-processes-communicating">Getting two <code>trahs</code> processes communicating</h3>
<p>To help you get to the interesting part of the assignment as soon as possible, here is an example of how to get two <code>trahs</code> processes communicating over ssh. On the client, this code checks for an environment variable <code>TRASSH</code>, which should contain an <code>@</code> character. The name of the host is then substituted for the <code>@</code> character, and the directory is appended. By default, if there is no <code>TRASSH</code> environment variable, it uses:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -CTaxq @ ./trahs --server</code></pre>
<p>Using the default, if you execute <code>./trahs server:server-dir client-dir</code>, the code will spawn:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -CTaxq server ./trahs --server server-dir</code></pre>
<p>which is what you want if you put a symbolic link to <code>trahs</code> in your home directory as recommended above.</p>
<p>Another useful thing about this setup is that you can get two copies of <code>trahs</code> talking to each other on the same machine without needing an ssh server by manipulating the <code>TRASSH</code> environment variable. For instance:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">export</span> <span class="ot">TRASSH=</span><span class="st">"</span><span class="ot">$HOME</span><span class="st">/trahs --server"</span>
$ <span class="kw">./trahs</span> hostname-does-not-matter:dir1 dir2</code></pre>
<p>Note that this approach doesn't work when there is whitespace in directory names. You don't need to worry about this case.</p>

<h2 id="due-date">Due Date</h2>
<p>Lab 3 should be submitted by the start of class (12:50pm) on <em>Thursday, May 8th</em>. However, you can have a free extension to midnight if you show up to lecture on time. We encourage you to complete the lab sooner, however, so as to work on your projects.</p>
<p>You have 48 hours of late days for the three labs. They are consumed in 24 hour blocks and are used automatically. After they are used, you'll have the maximum grade you can receive for a late lab reduced by 25% each day.</p>
<h2 id="cabal----build-test-tool">cabal -- build &amp; test tool</h2>
<p>cabal is the standard build and packaging tool for haskell. a starting framework is provided for you. you can find the user guide for cabal <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#test-suites">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="provided-files">provided files</h2>
<p>the files provided to get started are:</p>
<ul>
<li>trahs.cabal -- specifies the build system.</li>
<li>Main.hs -- main module, functions as the executable for trahs</li>
<li>src/Trahs.hs -- the trahs library, you should edit this file to implement lab3.</li>
<li>test/Test.hs-- the test harness. you need to edit this and add your own tests!</li>
</ul>
<p>if you add any new files, please make sure to add them into <code>trahs.cabal</code> as otherwise they won't be packaged up when you run <code>cabal sdist</code> and then they won't be sumitted.</p>
<p>The reason for this separation of <code>Main.hs</code> and <code>src/Trah.hs</code> is that it allows us to compile all your code as a library so that we can import it into our test framework with cabal and avoid recompiling it for both building and testing.</p>
<h2 id="building-lab-3">building lab 3</h2>
<p>To get up and running (using cabal), issue the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>    cabal sandbox init</code></pre>
<p>This will initiate a self-contained build environment where any dependencies you need are installed locally in the current directory. This helps avoid the haskell equivalent of "dll hell!" If your version of cabal is older such that it doesn't have the <code>sandbox</code> command, then just proceed without it and it should all be fine.</p>
<p>Next, you want to build the lab. for that, issue the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>    cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
    cabal configure --enable-tests
    cabal build</code></pre>
<p>After that, you should also be able to run the test harness simply by typing:</p>
<pre><code>    cabal test</code></pre>
<p>and you'll get some pretty output!</p>
<h2 id="testing-lab-3">testing lab 3</h2>
<p>Some skeleton code for a test framework is provided in <code>test/Test.hs</code>. you'll need to edit it to add your own tests. The test framework uses a haskell package called <a href="http://hspec.github.io/">hspec</a>. Please refer to it for documentation on how to use it.</p>
<p>We also strongly encourage the use of <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck">quick check</a>! It can be integrated with the test driver that hspec provides, please see the skeleton code that has an example of how.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>While we strongly encourage you to take testing seriously and write a comprehensive test suite, we are only going to grade you on the <code>trahs</code> executable itself.</p>
<p>Grading will be just done on functionality but we will try to give feedback on your coding style.</p>
<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>
<p>First, simply type:</p>
<pre><code>    cabal sdist</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a tar file of your code in <code>dist/trahs.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<p>Then go to <a href="http://upload.ghc.io/">upload.ghc.io</a> and submit your work through the online form. You can resubmit as many times as you want up until the deadline.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble submitting on-line, then please email <img id="email" class="img-responsive" style="display:inline-block;padding-bottom:4px;" width="280" height="10" src="./Stanford CS240h Lab 3_files/staff.png" alt="staff email">.</p>
